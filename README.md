# OTP-Based Email Login System

## Project Overview
This project implements an OTP-based login system using React.js, replacing traditional password authentication. The system enhances security and user convenience by generating a one-time password (OTP) and validating user input within a time limit.

## Objectives
1. Authentication: OTP-based login for enhanced security.
2. Design Consistency: UI adheres strictly to the provided design specifications.
3. Development:
    Generates a random OTP and displays it via an alert.
    OTP is valid for 30 seconds.
    If the user enters the correct OTP within the time limit, they are redirected to the dashboard.
    Incorrect or expired OTPs will prompt the user to request a new OTP.
    OTP data is managed using local storage or a data.json file.
4. Deployment: Hosted on Netlify or Vercel.
